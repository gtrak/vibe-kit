The code here and in related repositories is an ongoing experiment and hobby platform for myself. It is mostly vibe-coded, but I do
intend to review and iterate on these implementations with more LLM help or sometimes manually.  Anything you see here is something I
feel confident about representing the intent I had when I started, but I don't know if it's a meaningful improvement or even not-awful 
until I attempt to use it in service of some other work.

I don't have clear maintenance intentions going forward, so please use this code and depend upon it at your own risk. I may or may not
accept contributions.  I might delete it, replace it, retire, or otherwise abandon these projects. The interfaces are unstable and may
change as I see fit.
